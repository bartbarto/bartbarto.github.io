My Final Project for school.

A 3D Carnival where you can drive in the bumper cars, shoot at stuff, fish for ducks, take a selfie, play basket like a pro and fly like a pilot.
I made this together with Robbert Wolfs (
[@MisterWolfs][wolfs]
), who made the basket game, the shooting game, and the main website.
You can play these games using a Leap Motion, your smartphone, or just your mouse and keyboard.
